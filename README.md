# Plumbing-Company-PM-Project
A plumbing company contract fulfillment project, involves replacing the pipes and form by specialized workers and going through all the necessary steps for a quality installation, rigorous quality assurance for best possible results.


The project mostly works in a waterfall model.
The task cannot start unless the previous one if finished, and if one task is halte the rest of the project will be affected and cannot continue.
The final task, final analysis, can start at the same time as the one before it, meaning it's not part of the critical path.
